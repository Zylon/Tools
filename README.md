# Tools
I'll upload mostly AHK scripts 

**(and compile them to .exe for all of you without AHK)**

So you can either download the `.ahk` script and run it with AHK yourself, or if you don't have/want AHK you can download the `.exe`.

These are scripts that'll make your life just ever-so-slightly-less-annoying.

#Credentials generator for NadekoBot
I made a small script that'll ask you for all the information needed to make the credentials file, and then create it in the same directory as the script was running in.

#Custom Reactions tool for NadekoBot
Another little tool that'll let you add custom reactions trough a little window (for now), the program has to be placed inside `NadekoBot.v*.**\data` (where the config.json file is located)
