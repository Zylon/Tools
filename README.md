#What?
##First of all
###A disclaimer
These tools are not 100% tested, if you run into any problems it is not my fault.  
For any bug reports and/or questions, use the Issues tab. or visit my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sbZgha2)

The installer is discontinued due to the fact that this is being made by someone else *(Properly)*.
It is also outdated, so it will install the wrong version.

The custom reaction adder is also discontinued due to the high likelyhood of the custom reactions working completely different.

I will work on these when 1.0 gets here.
#Installer for NadekoBot
IS **OUTDATED** read above for more information.
I'm trying to make an installer for Nadeko, It's currently capable of:
*Installing NadekoBot
*Ask for credentials to automatically make the `credentials.json` file so you don't have to manually do that

###Heads up!!
It's downsides:
Do **NOT** click wildly on other screens, just listen to some music or pay some more attention to your background while the installation is happening
Do **NOT** type! I am sorry for this, but right now there is a slight chance you time your keypress with a prompt and may interupt or cancel the progress and crash the script.

Simply put, Just patiently wait for the install to be done, once it says "Succesfully installed NadekoBot" you're free to click and type all you want.

# Tools
I'll upload mostly AHK scripts.  
**(and compile them to .exe for all of you without AHK)**  
So you can either download the `.ahk` script and run it with AHK yourself, or if you don't have/want AHK you can download the `.exe`.  
These are scripts that'll make your life just ever-so-slightly-less-annoying.

#Credentials generator for NadekoBot
I made a small script that'll ask you for all the information needed to make the credentials file, and then create it in the same directory as the script was running in.

#Custom Reactions tool for NadekoBot
Still works for all version 0.9x and lower. will be continued and remade once 1.0 hits.
Read top for more information.

Another tool that'll let you add custom reactions trough a window, the program can either be placed inside `NadekoBot.v*.**\data` (where the config.json file is located).  
Or somewhere else, and it will ask you about the position of the `config.json` file.

#Counter
This is a mostly useless tool, it will run 1.000.000.000 loops and return you the time spend doing this.

Fun fact:

Language | Time *in seconds* 
--- | --- 
C | 2.12 
Python | 60.17 
AHK | Aprox 1.000.000
