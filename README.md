##First of all
###A disclaimer

If you happened to stumble on this page by accident or coincidence.  
Most of this will mean nothing to you.

# Tools
I'll upload mostly AHK scripts.  
**(and compile them to .exe for all of you without AHK)**  
So you can either download the `.ahk` script and run it with AHK yourself, or if you don't have/want AHK you can download the `.exe`.  
These are scripts that'll make your life just ever-so-slightly-less-annoying.

#Credentials generator for NadekoBot
I made a small script that'll ask you for all the information needed to make the credentials file, and then create it in the same directory as the script was running in.

#Custom Reactions tool for NadekoBot
Another tool that'll let you add custom reactions trough a window, the program can either be placed inside `NadekoBot.v*.**\data` (where the config.json file is located).  
Or somewhere else, and it will ask you about the position of the `config.json` file.

#Installer for NadekoBot
I'm currently trying to make an installer for Nadeko, It's only in Alpha right now because it isn't stable and only downloads the installation files. *(for now)*

###Heads up
If you are gonna try this installer, don't do other stuff like typing or actively changing window focus as this will result in the script crashing and not moving forward.

#Counter
This is a mostly useless tool, it will run 1.000.000.000 loops and return you the time spend doing this.

Fun fact:

Language | Time *in seconds*

C | 2.12 
Python | 60.17 
AHK | Aprox 1.000.000
