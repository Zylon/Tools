# Tools
I'll upload mostly AHK scripts 
**(and compile them to .exe for all of you without AHK)**
So you can either download the `.ahk` script and run it with AHK yourself, or if you don't have/want AHK you can download the `.exe`.
These are scripts that'll make your life just ever-so-slightly-less-annoying.

#Credentials generator for Nadeko
I made a small script that'll ask you for all the information needed to make the credentials file, and then create it in the same directory as the script was running in.
